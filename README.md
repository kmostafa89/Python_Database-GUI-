# Python_Database_GUI using SQlite and Tkinter

 I will be creating an application that lets users view , search , insert , delete and update data in a database from a GUI desktop application.
 
there will be the frontend.py and backend.py files in this project

In the frontend.py I will be coding the front end of the project which is done through tkinter to code the buttons , list box , scroll bar , entry boxes and labels.

In the backend.py I will be coding the back end of the porject which is to create a database in sqlite3 and writing appropriate queries to view , search , insert , delete and update data from the database.
